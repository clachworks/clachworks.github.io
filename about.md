Clachworks is building an accessible tool library, workshop, community garden and cafe in Inverness. 
As a new social enterprise, it seeks to share the tools to build things, skills and the friendships.
 
The average power drill is only used for 13 minutes in its lifetime.
Given that around four fifths of Scotland’s carbon footprint stems from the production, consumption and waste of manufactured goods (Zero Waste Scotland, 2020), this is a terrible use of the earth’s resources.  A recent survey carried out by Clachworks revealed that 73% of respondents in Inverness have tools in their house that they don’t use throughout the year, and yet 54% said that they required tools each year that they don’t own. This is clearly as much a local issue as it is a national one. 
 
Clachworks is determined to find ways that skills, knowledge and resources can be shared. 
Clachworks prioritises the circular economy which promotes the ‘make, remake and reuse’ life-cycle of material goods, as opposed to the linear growth model of ‘take, make, use, discard’.
 
By sharing resources, Clachworks aims to:
1.     Lower personal costs for individuals.
2.     Reduce the overall consumption and waste of goods.
3.     Foster skills development and community empowerment.
