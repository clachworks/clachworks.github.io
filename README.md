## Clachworks: a space for making and remaking

![toolsworkshop](/toolsworkshop.png)

Clachworks is a new social enterprise that plans to open a socially inclusive space for making and remaking in Inverness. We believe that the tools, skills and resources needed to create and repair things shouldn’t cost the earth, and should be accessible to all. As such, we have plans to open a tool library, open-access workshop space, community garden and cafe. 

We are currently in our start-up phase and look forward to sharing more news with you soon. 

In the meantime, if you would like to donate tools, time or money to help make this a reality, please get in touch. [email us](mailto:clachworks@gmail.com).
We’d love to hear from you! 

Please also visit our ‘get involved’ page to find out more about an exciting opportunity to join our board.

Clachworks is a not-for-profit community interest company (SC683808).
