## Clachworks: a space for making and remaking

![toolsworkshop](/toolsworkshop.png)

Clachworks is a new social enterprise that plans to open a socially inclusive space for making and remaking in Inverness. We believe that the tools, skills and resources needed to create and repair things shouldn’t cost the earth, and should be accessible to all. As such, we have plans to open a tool library, open-access workshop space, community garden and cafe. 

We are currently in our start-up phase and look forward to sharing more news with you soon. 

In the meantime, if you would like to donate tools, time or money to help make this a reality, please get in touch. [email us](mailto:clachworks@gmail.com).
We’d love to hear from you! 

Please also visit our [‘get involved’] page to find out more about an exciting opportunity to join our board.

Clachworks is a not-for-profit community interest company (SC683808). 

# About

Clachworks is building an accessible tool library, workshop, community garden and cafe in Inverness. 
As a new social enterprise, it seeks to share the tools to build things, skills and the friendships.
 
The average power drill is only used for 13 minutes in its lifetime.
Given that around four fifths of Scotland’s carbon footprint stems from the production, consumption and waste of manufactured goods (Zero Waste Scotland, 2020), this is a terrible use of the earth’s resources.  A recent survey carried out by Clachworks revealed that 73% of respondents in Inverness have tools in their house that they don’t use throughout the year, and yet 54% said that they required tools each year that they don’t own. This is clearly as much a local issue as it is a national one. 
 
Clachworks is determined to find ways that skills, knowledge and resources can be shared. 
Clachworks prioritises the circular economy which promotes the ‘make, remake and reuse’ life-cycle of material goods, as opposed to the linear growth model of ‘take, make, use, discard’.
 
By sharing resources, Clachworks aims to:
1.     Lower personal costs for individuals.
2.     Reduce the overall consumption and waste of goods.
3.     Foster skills development and community empowerment.
